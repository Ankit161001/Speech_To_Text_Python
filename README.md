# Speech_To_Text_Python
This is a simple python code to convert an audio file and print its contents as text using the python
SpeechRecognition module. The user need to input the location of the audio file that needs to be converted into text,
and the audio is converted into text and printed as output.

<br>
Before beginning with the code make sure you have python installed on your system. If not, head to `python.org` to download and install it. 
Make sure to check the `add python to PATH` button during installation.
After installing python open command prompt and type `pip install SpeechRecognition`. This command will install the required module.

**Note1: be sure to input the perfect directory/location of the audio file to be converted into text.** 
<br>
**Note2: the audio file must be in .wav format.**

I have also included the audio file that I converted into text. Feel free to use it for testing.
